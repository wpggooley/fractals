 * Double-click fractals.html
 * You can generate four different types of fractals at a user-input number of

Note:
 * some fractals grow more quickly than others, start with few iterations
 * arrowhead & koch appears near bottom left (scroll down)
 * dragon and gosper appears near middle (scroll down and right)

Enjoy!
